# The Tremor Project

## Pathway to do Error Handling in our project 

> Is anything missing or wrong please tell me :)

- [ ] Take a look an error handling of `rust` or `erlang` languages.
- [ ] Compare different crates such as [`eyre`](https://github.com/yaahc/eyre), [`color_eyre`](https://github.com/yaahc/color-eyre), [`anyhow`](https://github.com/dtolnay/anyhow) or [`thiserror`](https://github.com/dtolnay/thiserror) and find the most suitable crate for our tremor project.
- [ ] Make a list of error types [**very important**].
- [ ] [`linkerd2-proxy`](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2-proxy) has a similar project structure to ours and uses `thiserror` for error handling. So, Can we first study on this project `error handling system` ?
- [ ] Take a look of our `error-handling-system` and start implementing the best suitable crate for error handler.
